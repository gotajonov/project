Terraform:
1. AMI could be automated instead of manual providing (https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/data-sources/ami)
2. public key for ssh key pair could be a separate file and uploaded with file function
resource "aws_key_pair" "nhw76" {
public_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")
}
3. missing few variables
4. did not use tfvars file (https://spacelift.io/blog/terraform-tfvars)
5. github repo code has static variable
6. did not use module
7. Missing Readme file for tf module (https://www.redpill-linpro.com/techblog/2021/02/11/terraform_documentation_with_terraform_docs.html)
